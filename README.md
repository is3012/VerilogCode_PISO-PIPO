# VerilogCode_PISO-PIPO
Verilog code for PISO and PIPO registers with test bench
ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT:
The Shift Register is another type of sequential logic circuit that can
be used for the storage or the transfer of binary data
Shift Registers are used for data storage or for the movement of
data and are therefore commonly used inside calculators or
computers to store data such as two binary numbers before they are
added together, or to convert the data from either a serial to parallel
or parallel to serial format.
